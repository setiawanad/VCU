            <h3>Sorority History</h3>
            <p>alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1989, and recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. The fourteen founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan, dedicated themselves to establishing a strong and lasting organization, which would provide Asian-American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system. Soon after being recognized by the College Panhellenic Association, the founding sisters brought together a diverse group of women who shared with them the goals of sisterhood, scholarship, and leadership. These ideals would later set the foundation for alpha Kappa Delta Phi’s purpose.</p>

            <h3>Chapter History</h3>
            <p>In the winter of 2004, Kelly Huang found that there was no sorority at the Virginia  Commonwealth University that shared Asian culture with the rest of the Greek and University  community. In search to fill this void, she formed a group of women that would strive to establish alpha  Kappa Delta Phi at VCU. 
                In January of 2005, the interest group, Women In Sisterhood and Harmony, also known as  WISH, was born. Through creativity, perseverance and passion, WISH established relations with  organizations all over VCU’s campus and was recognized as an interest group by the Multicultural Greek  Council (MGC) on March 8, 2005. WISH created a strong presence in their community, established  unbreakable friendships and became unified through the time they spent together. Their dedication to  establish the first Asian-interest sorority at VCU grew and they felt ready to apply for colony status with  confidence and high expectations. 
                In the Spring 2006, after over a year of tireless effort, the fourteen women of WISH began the  process to form a chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the Virginia Commonwealth University. These  fourteen women, Chanda Cross, Melissa Fajardo, Nhi Ha, Kelly Huang, Gina Kang, Melissa Ly, Tina  Ng, Anh Phi Nguyen, Quynh-Phuong Nguyen, Zarah Liz Panaguiton, Celeste Thai, Angella Thuotte,  Amanda Wong, and Christy Wong, established a foundation for the growth of sisterhood for the future  women of VCU. They learned to work together through adversity, achieve goals with integrity and grow  in sisterhood and love in hopes that all those that come after would have the same pride.
